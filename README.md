# Comparing Classifiers F1 Score and Overfitting for Loan Approval Systems

The goal of the project is to explore and compare 8 classifier algorithms for a loan approval automated system, based on their f1 scores and tendency to overfit. The compared classifiers are:
1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
3. KNeighbors Classifier (KNN)
4. Decision Tree Classifier (DT)
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)
6. Support Vector Classification (SVC)
7. Random Forest Classifier (RF)
8. Voting Classifier (VC) - Combining LR and RF

This is inspired by a conference paper of [S. Srivastava (2024)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10866059), which compares between 5 algorithms based on accuracy scores. This research adds LDA, KNeighbors Classifier (KNN) and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) to the comparison, and uses f1 scoring instead. 

Data analysed is from [Kaggle's Loan Approval Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset) by Archit Sharma.

*PS: This project is done in parallel to my studies for MSc in AI at the University of Essex Online (UoEO) for the sake of exploration and practice. No general claims or arguments are intended.*
